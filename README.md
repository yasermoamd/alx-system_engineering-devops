## Introduction
  In this repo, you'll find brief summary of bash, permission,  shell and navigation commands.
  The table of contents will contain links that direct you to specific topics in order to make it easy when go over
  
## General 
  - What is a Shebang?
   The shebang is the combination of the # (pound key) and ! (exclamation mark). This character combination has a special meaning when it is used in the very first line of the script. It is used to specify the interpreter with which the given script will be run by default.
   * So, if the first line of a script is:
    `#!/bin/bash`

## Shell
   - What is the shell?
     shell is a program that takes commands from the keyboard and gives them to the operating system to perform.
   
   - What is the difference between a terminal and a shell?
    * Terminal is an environment text/output.
    * Shell is a command line interpreter.
   
   - What is shell prompt?
    * The shell prompt (or command line) is where one types commands. 
    
   - How to use the history (the basics)?
    * History command is used to view the previously executed command. This feature was not available in the Bourne shell.  
## Navigation Commands 
   * Print working directory `pwd`.
   * Change directory `cd`.
   * Display the contents list of your current directory `ls`.

## Manipulating Files
   * `cp`: command is used to copy files or directories from one location to another.
   * `mv`: command is used to rename files or directories, but also used to move files or directories to another location.
   * `rm`: command is used to remove files, and by adding `rm -r` you ca n remove a non-empty directory.

## Working with Commands
   * `type`: This command will tell you if a command is a built-in shell command, an alias, a function, or an executable file. 
   * `which`: This command will tell the location of the executable file for a command.
   * `help`: This command will show you a brief summary of a command's syntax and usage.
   * `man`: This command will display a full manual page of a command.
     - man page (short for manual page) is a form of software documentation usually found on a Unix or Unix-like operating system. 
### Summary 
  - So far we have a basic understanding when it comes to working with shell and bash language.
  - soon...
